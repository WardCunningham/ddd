      "text": "When a concrete analogy to the system emerges that captures the imagination of team members and seems to lead thinking in a useful direction, adopt it as a large-scale structure. Organize the design around this metaphor and absorb it into the [[ubiquitous language]]. The [[system metaphor]]should both facilitate communication about the system and guide development of it. This increases consistency in different parts of the system, potentially even across different [[bounded context]]. But because all metaphors are inexact, continually reexamine the metaphor for overextension or inaptness, and be ready to drop it if it gets in the way."
